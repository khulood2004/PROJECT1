QUESTIONS: 

1.- What was your motivation?

I wanted to deepen my understanding of Java, specifically using the switch statement and working with functions and methods. My goal was to improve my coding skills by tackling practical problems.

2.- Why did you build this project? 

I built this project to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting. It was a way to practice coding, improve problem-solving skills, and write cleaner.

3.- What problem does it solve?

The project was done to solve three cases: adding numbers, reading texts and finding the cosine of a number.

4.- What did you learn?

I learned to use the switch statement  for working with different cases. I also improved my ability to create and use functions and methods and math functions.

5.- What makes your project stand out? 

If your project has a lot of features consider adding a "Features" section and listing them here 

My project stands out because the code is clear and efficient. I used functions and methods to keep the logic well-organized. It's also designed to easily add new features or cases.
